# CS370-EmergingTrendsInCS

<ins>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</ins>  
I was tasked with designing an intelligent agent using a deep Q-learning algorithm for a treasure hunt game. I was given starter code and an environment where a pirate would navigate pathways to find treasure. My job was to complete the Q-Training Algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure the agent found the treasure.  

<ins>Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:</ins>  
  * <ins>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</ins>  
    Computer scientists analyze problems and develop solutions using coding methods. Their work helps advance technology by solving challenges for stakeholders and improving efficiency for specific industries.  

  * <ins>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</ins>  
    I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller parts.  Making the tasks maneagable is important to keep progress moving forward. I then apply computer science techniques to test solutions.  When all of this is complete, I can clean up and optimize code after ensuring the current code works.  

  * <ins>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</ins>  
    I need to ensure that solutions take into account user privacy, security, and biases.  Decisions need to be based on best practices over efficiency.  A readable code helps to show that security and privacy are utilized.
